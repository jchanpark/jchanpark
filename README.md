## Hi there 👋

# I'm Jay Park

I am a committed and enthusiastic coder with an eye for detail and persistent problem-solving skills. I have over a decade of project management experience in the engineering and automotive sectors. As a former industrial engineering project manager, I believe I have the tools needed to solve complex problems. Considering this, software development has always been attractive to me as you can reach solutions to various issues more creatively and efficiently.
